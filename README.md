# speckle-unity-core

An unofficial speckle connection for unity that
combines [speckle-unity-core](https://github.com/sasakiassociates/speckle-unity-core)
and [speckle-unity-objects](https://github.com/sasakiassociates/speckle-unity-objects) into one main package. This
project was started from the main [speckle-unity](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-unity) project, but has been
moved into different repos for more modular package support with unity.

This package features:

- `SpeckleConnector` - A manager object for accessing for easily accessing your speckle server from unity
- Operating with Speckle from the Editor and Runtime
- UI Toolkit packages for editor and runtime GUI

This pacakge can be installed with [OpenUpm](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli#installation)

`openupm add com.speckle.connector`
